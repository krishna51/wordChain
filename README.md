Word Chains problem


Write a program that given two valid words, find a chain of valid intermediate words, wherein each word in the chain differs in only one letter from its neighbors.  

Assume words are available in a dictionary.

The two words at each end of the chain are:  cat ~ dog. 

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as words of differing character lengths, memory and performance considerations for the project.
